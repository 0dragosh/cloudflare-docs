1.1.1.1 is a fast and private way to browse the Internet. It is a DNS resolver â€” meaning it is kind of like Google Maps for your computer, in that it translates places (like `cloudflare.com`) into addresses (like `2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2`).  

1.1.1.1 is deployed in more than 150 cities worldwide, and has access to the addresses of more than seven million domain names on the same servers it runs on, which makes it [the fastest resolver out there](https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers).

The addresses of 1.1.1.1 are:

- `1.1.1.1`
- `1.0.0.1`
- `2606:4700:4700::1111`
- `2606:4700:4700::1001`

1.1.1.1 also offers a version made for Families, which adds an additional layer of protection to your home network, shielding it from malware and adult content.

In addition to the regular DNS resolver, 1.1.1.1 also offers [DNS over HTTPS (DoH)](/encrypted-dns/dns-over-https) and [DNS over TLS (DoT)](/encrypted-dns/dns-over-tls) for increased security and privacy. You can also access 1.1.1.1 [as a Tor hidden service](/other-ways-to-use/dns-over-tor).
