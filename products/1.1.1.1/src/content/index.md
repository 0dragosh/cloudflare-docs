1.1.1.1 is a fast and private way to browse the Internet. It is a DNS resolver — meaning it is kind of like Google Maps for your computer, in that it translates places (like cloudflare.com) into addresses (like `2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2`). 

1.1.1.1 is deployed in 150+ cities worldwide, and has access to the addresses of 7M+ domain names on the same servers it runs on so [it’s the fastest resolver out there](https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers).

The addresses of 1.1.1.1 are:

- `1.1.1.1`
- `1.0.0.1`
- `2606:4700:4700::1111`
- `2606:4700:4700::1001`

1.1.1.1 also offers a version made for Families, which adds a layer of protection to your home network from malware and adult content.
