# Understanding Cloudflare Web Analytics

View your websiteâ€™s page views, visits, [page load time](/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/page-load-time-summary/), and [Core Web Vitals](/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/core-web-vitals/) by switching between views on the graph. You can also filter data by various [dimensions](/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/dimensions/).

## High-Level Metrics

<li>Visits - A a page view that originated from a different website or direct link. Cloudflare checks where the HTTP referer does not match the hostname. One visit can consist of multiple page views.
</li>
<li>Page views - A successful HTTP response with a content-type of HTML.</li>
<li>Page load time - The total amount of time required to load the page.</li>
<li>Core Web Vitals - Higher-level metrics designed by Google to capture the user experience more completely. </li>
</ul>
